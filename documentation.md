### Introduction
The overall concept for this application came from the lack of communication between Solent University and the students that attend there. Based on the survey sent to students it was determined that at least 50% of respondents did not find that the current application (Solent Portal) made the students aware of any changes, and the lack of communication between them and their lectures. Solent Portal does offer access to e-mails, as well as other functionality that will be available via SolentLife such as a map of the university, and a view of upcoming tasks, the issue with the Portal is that it is dated, the outlook browser is not suited for mobile browsers, making it difficult to respond to e-mails on the go, as well as the other functions mentioned prior before being equally difficult. While this app is available on mobile and desktop it does not seem that it was created with modern devices in mind, being dated in comparison to modern solutions.

 'SolentLife' is the intended solution that will solved all of the re-occuring issues found from the survey, offering push notifications, and a more streamline communications network between lecturer, and user. Having one login for all functions, authenticated by the students university e-mail meaning that no one from outside of the university can access the application ensuring security throughout. The functions implemented are based off of the survey responses determined prior, with this product being focussed on the design to show that such an application is viable and can be produced that is modern and has a good streamline interface. 

### Methodology
In the previous report the waterfall method was the intended development model, but, at the start of the process it was clear that this model would not be efficient for the development of this product due to the amount of testing, and changes that would take place throughout. Instead the Agile development model seems to be the best fit as it allows for brainstorming, designing, developing, testing and then repeating if nessecary.

 In the previous report the inital prototype was created and the first testing stages were completed, from this it was possible to see what the target audience would want from a new application, and what they thought of the concept brought forward. Using this data it it possible to produce a design that takes inspiration from the original Solent Portal. This first design will take feedback from the prototype testing which found that the menu idea first created did not really work as it was too hidden, as well as the calender being too "clunky", this new design will adjusted these aspects and has moved the menu to the top making it clearer, and made each page visually streamline. 

 Following on from this inital design the next testing phase will take place, due to the ongoing pandemic it is hard to create a real world testing experience so a simple test will be created to ensure that at least some data is available. This test will take screenshots of the current design and have the test subjects from the previous report view it. They can then give feedback on what they think of the changes, and whether or not there is anything else they'd like adding.

 These steps will then repeat until the test subjects are happy with the overall design. 


### Development & Testing
This section will be broken up into 3 stages, each stage containing the progession of the overall design of the product, the changes that have been made, and the reasoning behind each part.

#### Design 1
Design 1 took features from the inital prototype but built upon the test results from the previous section, these results showed that the menu was not visible enough and that the calender was simply too clunky and hard to follow. Based on this it was clear that the menu had to be completely redesigned and that the rest of the pages should follow some form of structure to ensure that the overall app is streamlined for the user. A mockup was created to give an idea of what the product should look like (Figure 1). Using this guidance each page was created at once to create the structure, they could then be produced one by one. This design was created and then ready for testing.

#### Testing Design 1
5 test subjects were sent the screenshots shown above and asked to give their opinion on what they thought of the colour scheme, the layout, and the menu design. Each subject responded with one sentence per question, these results are as follows:
###### Test Subject 1
Question 1 - Colour scheme
> I found the colour scheme to be nice and easy to look at.

Question 2 - Layout
> The layout is simple and makes it easy to read the text

Question 3 - Menu Design
> I still can't see where the button is for the menu.

###### Test Subject 2
Question 1 - Colour scheme
> Matches the university colours

Question 2 - Layout
> Cool and simple

Question 3 - Menu Design
> The menu is nice but the button still is not very visible

###### Test Subject 3
Question 1 - Colour scheme
> I think its nice

Question 2 - Layout
> Bit blocky but it is nice

Question 3 - Menu Design
> Better than before, still room for improvement

###### Test Subject 4
Question 1 - Colour scheme
> Its cool

Question 2 - Layout
> It works well

Question 3 - Menu Design
> Looks alright

###### Test Subject 5
Question 1 - Colour scheme
> Does the job, bit boring for me

Question 2 - Layout
> Nothing to complain about

Question 3 - Menu Design
> Still do not understand how you open it

#### Design 2
Based on the responses from the previous section its clear that the menu was again, not that well received so it best to rethink the idea and try again. This time the design stayed more true to the original prototype but took a different approach to see if that would work better. In this stage the product moved the header to the bottom, similar to the original prototype, but this time used a hamburger menu button. It also removed the gradient as it made it seem a bit much, the solid colour seems to fit more. The design looked as follows:

###### Figure 7

#### Testing Design 2
Following on from the next design the same test type was used as before, sending the test subjects the above screenshots and having them reply with their responses and opinions on the overall design.

###### Test Subject 1
Question 1 - Colour scheme
> The lighter colours are better

Question 2 - Layout
> I like the header at the bottom but the top is now too empty

Question 3 - Menu Design
> Having a clear menu button is a lot better

###### Test Subject 2
Question 1 - Colour scheme
> No different

Question 2 - Layout
> The menu is better at the bottom

Question 3 - Menu Design
> Much better

###### Test Subject 3
Question 1 - Colour scheme
> Its nice

Question 2 - Layout
> An indication of the page you are on would be nice

Question 3 - Menu Design
> Much better

###### Test Subject 4
Question 1 - Colour scheme
> Same as before

Question 2 - Layout
> Menu is nice at the bottom, although it leaves too much empty space 

Question 3 - Menu Design
> I like it

###### Test Subject 5
Question 1 - Colour scheme
> Simple

Question 2 - Layout
> Its okay

Question 3 - Menu Design
> Can see how you would open the menu

#### Design 3
This design again took feedback from the prior testing, which seemed to find that although the test subjects prefer the menu at the bottom, it leaves too much empty space in the rest of the application. Another comment made by test subject 3 was that an indication of the page would be nice, this gave me an idea for what could bring the page together a bit more. In this design a header was once again introduced but it is a simple translucent bar that says the page the user is on. This introduction pushed the rest of the contents further down the page filling it more. Additionally, further pages were developed as it seemed like this would be reaching the end of its design cycle. This design was produced and then sent out once again.

#### Testing Design 3
This testing stage removed question 1 and 3 as this aspect was not really changed that much in this stage. Instead 2 questions were asked, the same one about the layout, and a further question asking what they thought of the new pages e.g. login, map and calender.

###### Test Subject 1
Question 1 - Layout
> Having a header and a footer is much nicer

Question 2 - New pages
> All match and fit well together

###### Test Subject 2
Question 1 - Layout
> The top is nice

Question 2 - New pages
> The calender is much cleaner

###### Test Subject 3
Question 1 - Layout
> Showing the page is cool

Question 2 - New pages
> The logo on the login page is nice

###### Test Subject 4
Question 1 - Layout
> nothing to complain about

Question 2 - New pages
> The map is cool, and the calender is useful

###### Test Subject 5
Question 1 - Layout
> Its nice

Question 2 - New pages
> It all matches well

### Reasoning
Most of the aspects found in this product have been inspired by various other products found online, as well as the original Solent Portal app. These decisions can be broken down:

* Colour scheme - The colour scheme was inspired by Solent Portal. The original colours are clean and simple, using a slightly grey shade, and the red are a nice combination and it seemed wise to carry this over.
* Layout - Having a block design seemed the best way format, similar to that of social media. Facebook, and Twitter both use blocks to seperate data which makes it easy to read and follow. Having seperated blocks made the data in the app easy to follow and read. Additionally it means that all the pages are simple and will not confuse any new users. It will also make for easy future introductions of features. 
* Menu - The menu uses a unique design that is not often seen on websites, being placed at the bottom was simply because when using a mobile device having to reach to the top of the screen is getting harder and harder due to the size increase so placing it there means its always within reach to open. Furthermore, the menu itself is designed to fit half the screen for the same reason.

### Conclusion 
Overall the final application design showed the product initally described and met the majortive of requirements. The inital survey sent out brought back needs that each student represents, and hopefully this application can show that there is a design that is simple and works efficiently to make a university students day easier. Testing has shown that the design has been well recieved and is suitable for the target audience. Not only that but the responses have shown that the design has gone through multiple stages based on feedback and has grown from this. Every design decision is with reason, every feature has a purpose so there is nothing to interupt the users daily use. Such an application can make a big difference in communication, ensuring that nothing is missed.
